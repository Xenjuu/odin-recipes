    <h1>Bulalo</h1>
    <h3>Bulalo is a Filipino soup dish made with beef shank and bone marrow,
    simmered for several hours until the beef becomes tender and the broth is
    rich and flavorful. It is seasoned with onions, garlic, peppercorns, and
    fish sauce, and often includes vegetables such as corn on the cob, bok choy,
    and green beans. The bone marrow is a highlight of the dish, which is
    scooped out of the bones and added to the soup just before serving. Bulalo
    is a popular comfort food in the Philippines and is often served with rice
    and a dipping sauce made with calamansi and soy sauce</h3>

    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <h3>Here are the general steps for making bulalo:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>In a large pot, add the beef shank and enough water to cover it. Bring
      to a boil over high heat.</li>
      <li>Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and let it simmer for several
      hours (around 2-3 hours) until the beef is tender and the broth is rich
      and flavorful. Skim off any foam or impurities that rise to the
      surface</li>
      <li>Add the onions, garlic, peppercorns, and fish sauce to the pot and let
      it continue to simmer for another 10-15 minutes.</li>
      <li>Add the corn on the cob, bok choy, and green beans to the pot and
      continue to simmer for another 5-10 minutes until the vegetables are
      tender.</li>
      <li>Remove the beef shank and marrow bones from the pot and let them cool
      slightly. Then, scoop out the marrow from the bones and add it back to the
      pot.</li>
      <li>Season with salt to taste.</li>
      <li>Serve hot with steamed rice and a dipping sauce made with calamansi
      and soy sauce.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note: The cooking time may vary depending on the size and thickness of
    the beef shank. You may need to adjust the cooking time accordingly to
    ensure that the beef is cooked through and tender.</p>
